KDE Activate

A simple script that can be used to focus an app if it's already running or launch it if it's not. Usually used along with KDE shortcuts to navigate through apps. 

For example, I bind `ctrl + 1` to `chromium`.
  - when it's not open, this script will open it 
  - if it's already open, this script will bring it to the front and focus it
